this'll hold pipelines used to fetch data from all our sources

in terms of structure, what i'm going to do here is group based on device type. (we shouldn't box fusion into one location)

## Data sources

- [Meetings] Follow the instructions in the [google-calendar folder](./google-calendar/README.md)
- [Music] Follow the instructions in the [spotify-data folder](./spotify-data/README.md)
- [Productivity - github commits] Follow the instructions in the [github-data folder](./github-data/README.md)

Will likely move under analysisÏ€
