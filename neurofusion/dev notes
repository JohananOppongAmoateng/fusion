folder structure for uploaded data should be

<userid>/YYYY/MM/DD/<data-type>/<data-type_unixtimestamp.json>


build the best intuitive visualization
- allow to see visualization side by side


tagging recordings need to be built in

- 1665725683  - (ore)
...
- (all this data was from the wrong device, so the logs were empty)

- 1665739693  - (ore) - dev :p
- 1665731281
tends to start hurting at 30 - 2hours of use 

(found that std deviation was wrong on recording until this time)
- 1665785803  - (ore) mentally unfocused
- 1665786857  - (ore) somewhat working ... 
- 1665798130  - (ore) should do eyes closed with breathing

- 1665801014             
- 1665803634  - (ore) in the zone ish?

- 1665853539  - (ore) trying to focus & codev
...
- 1665856232  - (ore) same as above

- 1666015189  - (ore) in bellevue, getting into famasi dev
- 1666016658  - (ore) same as above

...
- 1666672250  - (ore) (h) some fusion work turned into free flow lol
- 1666676581  - (ore) sane as above
---------
frontend set up
- get the notion service wrapped
- need to do the login whether I like it or not
- add a button to start a recording

....

simple signon for user (like mixpanel and jargon)

makes sense storing device id in the localstorage
    - still need to add the neurosity provider

get user email -> (device id) -> store in local storage

next load fetch from local storage first

- signed in user, gets a neurosity device
    - device gets tied to userId stored in localstorage
        (de anonymised) for starters let users just know what you're collecting data for
            "we want to explore changes in brain activty over time
            and how it relates with behavior"
                - would you like to share data (y/n)

        - notes can even show what it looks like
        - (hehehehe for local first just save a ton of data in localstorage)
            - correlating with magicflow data
                - (i should get a data scientist)

....

I'm so excited, gonna get to viewing experiments natively sooon!!!
 - i dream of a future with labjs style experiments and analyis on data
    - then imagine pairing with other physio signals
        - I actually should just get those initial one on homepage.

oura (reg health)
magicflow (actions on device)
neurosity (brain activity)

what's a good statistical correlation I can use for this
    - think about meaning (reference stats material)


(should look at neurosity dev vscode app )


--- later
eeg haptics will be fun for dev experiemnts
