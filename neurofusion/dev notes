folder structure for uploaded data should be

<userid>/YYYY/MM/DD/<data-type>/<data-type_unixtimestamp.json>

build the best intuitive visualization
- allow to see visualization side by side

tagging recordings need to be built in - done

------
core data integrations
----------------------
neurosity (brain activity)
magicflow (actions on device)
oura (reg health)

----
analysis
- (eeg) power spectral analysis
- (productivity)
- (health) from oura, heart rate over time (sleeping , awake)
- (eeg) foof? to the get the predominant frequency over brain noise
- (health) should look at "sleep rebound on rem"
- spectrogram - use these together with power to indentify times of interest.

....

I'm so excited, gonna get to viewing experiments natively sooon!!!
 - i dream of a future with labjs style experiments and analyis on data
    - then imagine pairing with other physio signals
        - I actually should just get those initial one on homepage.


questions:
- what's a good statistical correlation I can use for this
    - think about meaning (reference stats material)

later:

[] spend a full period on data storage and sync.

[] properly design the analysis view based on available data streams

Idea! Have you considered taking screenshots with Magicflow & storing on user device - itâ€™ll really help with categorization

---
- signalquality seems to be better when my head is bent downwards...
- desperately need signal helper

integrating brain dump - capturing text from keyboard, sit locally on device


local version of neurofusion..

the desire to call people



I should get an EA - or actually even better, use AI to be my EA
- Insights from productivity data
 - whats different in the things I've been spending my time doing (interests)
