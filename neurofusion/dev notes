analysis
- (eeg) power spectral analysis
- (productivity)
- (health) from oura, heart rate over time (sleeping , awake)

tagging outcomes
- when I'm changing context from one activity to the other
- tracking movement periods

- 1675276805 - more randmoness (drinking coffee and reading)

- 1675284254 - famasi dev 

questions:
- what's a good statistical correlation I can use for this
    
    - bin the powerByBand values to 'x' seconds averages

    - think about meaning (reference stats material)

- [] properly design the analysis view based on available data streams
----

Idea! Have you considered taking screenshots with Magicflow & storing on user device - it’ll really help with categorization

---
- [] signalquality seems to be better when my head is bent downwards...
- [] desperately need signal helper

integrating brain dump - capturing text from keyboard, sit locally on device


local version of neurofusion..

(wait for a minute first to get good signal quality)

I should get an EA - or actually even better, use AI to be my EA
- Insights from screen time on what activities new following up on
 - whats different in the things I've been spending my time doing (interests)
