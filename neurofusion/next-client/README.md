{Adding extra changes...}

## Getting your localhost to run https

- Install the mkcert utility by running
  `brew install mkcert` (if you're using macOS) or
  by downloading the appropriate package for your system from the mkcert Github repository: https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert

- Once mkcert is installed, run the following commands to create a local certificate authority and generate a certificate for localhost:

```
mkcert -install
mkcert localhost
```

- Move the generated localhost.pem and localhost-key.pem files to the `cert` directory of your Next.js project.

```
mv localhost.pem cert/
mv localhost-key.pem cert/
```

- update your `.env.local` file to include

```
HTTPS=true
```

- Start the local server using

```
node server.js
```
