# Fusion
What do we find when we stop treating our usage data across apps as a by-product but as signals that we could use to understand ourselves better? 

## Install dependencies

- Create a new anaconda environment
```conda create -n fusion```

After creating the enviroment, it is activated by default. To switch between conda environments, use this command ```conda activate environment-name``` where 'environment-name' can be `fusion` or `base`

When you open this project for the first time, run this command
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
